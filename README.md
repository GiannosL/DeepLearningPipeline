<h1>Multi-perceptron for classification pipeline</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a pipeline which automates classification projects using a simple multi-layered perceptron. The pipeline has some basic data exploration features along with the option to generate some plots. The prediction results come along with some rudimentary statistics as well as the ability to vizualized them easily. This pipeline was built with the goal of providing a template which can be easily expanded upon.
</p>
<p>
The deep-learning infrastructure used in the pipeline is based on the <em>PyTorch</em> framework.
